# MAMOS Security Considerations

This document outlines key security considerations and best practices for the MAMOS (Manus Agent Management & Orchestration System) platform.

## 1. Agent Authentication and Authorization

*   **One-Time Registration Tokens**: Agents register with the Orchestrator using unique, short-lived tokens. These tokens should be used once and then invalidated.
*   **JWT-based Authentication**: After registration, agents receive a JSON Web Token (JWT) for subsequent authenticated communication with the Orchestrator. JWTs should have a reasonable expiration time and be refreshed securely.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implement RBAC on the Orchestrator to ensure that only authorized users/agents can perform specific actions.

## 2. Command Execution Whitelisting

*   **Strict Whitelist**: The MAMOS Agent *must* only execute commands that are explicitly defined in a whitelist. Any attempt to execute a non-whitelisted command should be rejected and logged.
*   **No Arbitrary Code Execution**: Prevent agents from executing arbitrary code received from the Orchestrator. All commands should be pre-defined and parameters carefully sanitized.
*   **Input Sanitization**: All inputs to commands (e.g., arguments) must be thoroughly sanitized to prevent injection attacks (e.g., command injection).

## 3. Data Security

*   **Encryption in Transit**: All communication between the Dashboard, Orchestrator, and Agents should use TLS/SSL (HTTPS/WSS) to protect data in transit.
*   **Data at Rest**: Sensitive data stored in the Orchestrator's database (e.g., API keys, registration tokens) should be encrypted at rest. Even for MVP with SQLite, consider file system encryption.
*   **Logging**: Implement secure logging practices. Avoid logging sensitive information (passwords, tokens) directly. Ensure log files are protected with appropriate permissions.

## 4. Network Security

*   **Firewall Rules**: Configure firewalls to restrict access to MAMOS components. Only necessary ports should be open (e.g., 3000 for Dashboard, 4000 for Orchestrator, 9090 for Prometheus, 3001 for Grafana).
*   **Network Segmentation**: Isolate MAMOS components within a private network where possible, especially for the Orchestrator and database.

## 5. Environment Variables and Secrets Management

*   **No Hardcoded Secrets**: Never hardcode sensitive information (e.g., JWT secrets, database credentials) directly in the codebase.
*   **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for configuration. For Docker deployments, leverage Docker secrets or environment files (`.env`).
*   **Secure Storage**: For production, consider using a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Kubernetes Secrets).

## 6. Regular Audits and Updates

*   **Dependency Scanning**: Regularly scan project dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
*   **Security Audits**: Conduct periodic security audits and penetration testing.
*   **Software Updates**: Keep all MAMOS components, libraries, and underlying operating systems up to date to patch security vulnerabilities.
