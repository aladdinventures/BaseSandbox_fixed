# Operational Report: Live Monorepo Project Status Dashboard

**Author:** Manus AI
**Date:** Oct 14, 2025 PDT

## 1. Introduction

This report outlines a strategy for implementing a live dashboard to visualize the idea-to-production journey within a monorepo environment. The goal is to provide a graphical representation and a clear timeline of project status, enabling better oversight and decision-making for a solo developer managing multiple projects.

## 2. Research and Best Practices for Monorepo Dashboards

Effective monorepo dashboards require a focus on aggregating data from various sources to provide a holistic view of project health and progress. Key considerations include [1, 2]:

*   **Centralized Visibility**: A single pane of glass for all projects within the monorepo.
*   **Granular Insights**: Ability to drill down into specific project metrics, CI/CD pipeline statuses, and deployment details.
*   **Real-time Updates**: Essential for a 

live dashboard to reflect the current state of the system.
*   **Customizability**: Dashboards should be adaptable to display the most relevant metrics for your specific workflow.

## 3. Key Metrics and Stages for Visualization

To visualize the idea-to-production journey, we need to track projects through several key stages and measure relevant metrics at each stage [3, 4].

| Stage             | Key Metrics                                     | Data Sources                                  |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Idea/Planning** | Number of open issues/tasks, task progress      | Project Management Tool (e.g., Jira, Trello)  |
| **Development**   | Commit frequency, branch activity, pull requests | Git Repository (e.g., GitHub)                 |
| **CI/CD**         | Build/test duration, success/failure rate       | CI/CD Platform (e.g., GitHub Actions)         |
| **Staging**       | Deployment frequency, uptime, performance metrics | Monitoring Tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana)  |
| **Production**    | Deployment frequency, uptime, error rate        | Monitoring Tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana)  |

## 4. Conceptual Architecture and Recommended Tools

The proposed architecture for the live dashboard consists of four main components:

1.  **Data Sources**: The raw data from your development and operational tools.
2.  **Data Collection & Processing**: A service to collect, aggregate, and process data from the various sources.
3.  **Data Storage**: A time-series database to store the collected metrics.
4.  **Visualization**: A dashboarding tool to visualize the data.

### Recommended Tools:

*   **Data Collector**: A custom service written in **Python** or **Node.js** that uses APIs and webhooks to collect data from GitHub (commits, pull requests, Actions) and your project management tool.
*   **Time-Series Database**: **Prometheus** is a powerful open-source monitoring system with a time-series database that is well-suited for this purpose [5]. **InfluxDB** is another excellent alternative.
*   **Visualization**: **Grafana** is the industry standard for creating beautiful, interactive, and real-time dashboards [6]. It integrates seamlessly with Prometheus and other data sources.

## 5. High-Level Implementation Plan

Here is a high-level plan for implementing the live project dashboard:

1.  **Set up Monitoring Infrastructure**:
    *   Deploy Prometheus and Grafana using Docker Compose.
    *   Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from your applications and the data collector.
    *   Configure Grafana to use Prometheus as a data source.

2.  **Develop the Data Collector Service**:
    *   Create a new service (e.g., in Python) within your monorepo under `apps/`.
    *   Implement logic to fetch data from the GitHub API (commits, pull requests, Actions status).
    *   Expose the collected data as Prometheus metrics.

3.  **Instrument CI/CD Pipelines**:
    *   Modify your GitHub Actions workflows to send metrics to the data collector or expose them for Prometheus to scrape.
    *   Track key metrics like build duration, test coverage, and deployment status.

4.  **Build the Grafana Dashboard**:
    *   Create a new dashboard in Grafana.
    *   Add panels to visualize the metrics collected from Prometheus.
    *   Create a timeline view to represent the idea-to-production journey, using stages and metrics defined in Section 3.

5.  **Integrate with MAMOS (Optional but Recommended)**:
    *   The live dashboard can be integrated into the MAMOS dashboard as a new page or an embedded iframe, providing a single point of access for all your operational insights.

## 6. Conclusion

By implementing this live project dashboard, you will gain a powerful tool for visualizing the entire development lifecycle within your monorepo. This will enable you to identify bottlenecks, track progress, and make data-driven decisions to improve your development workflow. The recommended tools (Prometheus and Grafana) are open-source, highly scalable, and widely used in the industry, ensuring a robust and future-proof solution.
